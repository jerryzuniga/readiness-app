  "Exploring": "Your organization is at the Exploring stage. You are actively investigating feasibility. The team should focus on gathering community data, assessing internal capacity, and determining if a repair program aligns with your mission.",
  "Planning": "Your organization is at the Planning stage. You have identified key gaps and are aligning around strategies. It is time to develop concrete roadmaps, draft policies, and secure initial commitments to move toward a pilot.",
  "Preparing": "Your organization is at the Preparing stage. You have a plan in place and are mobilizing resources. Focus on finalizing internal systems, training staff, and securing funding to ensure a successful launch.",
  "Ready": "Your organization is at the Ready stage. You are positioned for implementation or scale. The focus shifts to execution, sustainability, measuring impact, and deepening partnerships for long-term success."
